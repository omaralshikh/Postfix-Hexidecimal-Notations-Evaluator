# Postfix-Hexidecimal-Notations-Evaluator


You are to write a Python program that computes the value of bitwise manipulated expressions provided in postfix hexadecimal notation.
For example, given the string “8<>1><|~”(infix: “~(><8|<>1)”),
your calculator will compute “f” as the answer.  All strings provided will be valid.  All numbers will be single, 4-bit hexadecimal digits (0-f). 

Your calculator will use a stack to compute/store all intermediate computations.  
You will implement your own push and pop stack operations.
